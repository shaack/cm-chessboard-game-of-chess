# cm-chessboard-playfield

A cm-chessboard plugin which knows the rules of chess to validate moves, support promotions and does some fancy square marking. This is the cm-chessboard extension which has it all to play chess.

Work in progress, which is planned to

- do move validation âœ…
- keep track of the moves history 
- set markers for last move, check, invalid move, legal moves etc.
- display a promotion dialog, if needed âœ…
- allow premoves
- add sounds ðŸ¥³

This will replace many parts of my https://github.com/shaack/chess-console project and make it easier to use.
