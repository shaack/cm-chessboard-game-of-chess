# cm-chessboard-playfield

A cm-chessboard extension which knows the rules of chess to validate moves, support promotions and does some fancy square marking.

[See the demo page](https://shaack.com/projekte/cm-chessboard-playfield/)

Work in progress, all features are implemented for now. It's also in use in production at https://www.chessmail.eu and https://www.chessmail.de

- do move validation ✅
- keep track of the moves history ✅
- set markers for last move, check, invalid move, legal moves etc. ✅
- display a promotion dialog, if needed ✅
- add sounds ✅
- allow premoves ✅

This will replace many parts of my https://github.com/shaack/chess-console project and make it easier to use.
